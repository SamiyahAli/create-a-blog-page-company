            <h3 class="title">Telework</h3>
            <p class="text">What is the meaning of flexibility in doing business?
                <br>
                The method of defining flexibility at work may vary, but we can describe it as adaptability to developments
                 and unexpected events and the willingness to perform work effectively, whatever the circumstances.
                And when we talk about the importance of flexibility at work, we describe that ability to adapt all circumstances
                 to help individuals perform their work regardless of the limits of place and time.
            </p>
            <p class="text">Has the pandemic changed the face of business forever?
                <br>
                We have seen how the Corona pandemic has forced everyone to break away from all the traditional methods of doing business.
                 Now, it has become very clear that working after Corona is not at all like working before it, as many companies have adopted 
                 new strategies on them and are applying remote work as an integral part of their system or temporarily to deal with business 
                 during the crisis.
                </p>
            <p class="text">How does flexibility achieve great results while working remotely?
                <br>
                Change requires good planning and preparation, but change can be abrupt, making resilience an essential quality with 
                which success can only be achieved. </p>

            <p class="text">
                Beautiful Internet of Things concept
When we talk about the concept of the beautiful Internet of Things, we are not only talking about a technical perspective; We are also talking about a humanistic or behavioral perspective. The Internet of Things is usually defined as connecting devices/sensors to each other via a specific IP Address, through which data is received or sent. The question here is how can we use this data and benefit from it to improve the quality of people's lives in general?
<br>
<br>
Statistics about the percentage of used devices connected to the Internet
Hardly any home/personal technical device is devoid of being connected to the Internet.
 Smart TV, electronic games, and other smart devices have become necessary to be connected 
 to the network in one way or another. 

 <br>
 The latest global statistics have shown that the number of devices connected to the Internet 
 has reached 50 billion devices, which is considered a large number.
 The goal of the beautiful Internet of Things is to develop smart applications to make them 
 consistent with our daily lives, by improving human behaviors and activities.<br>
  The infrastructure in Saudi Arabia will also contribute to activating innovative solutions 
  for the Internet of Things.

            <p class="text">Open source technologies have flourished and depended upon by individuals and organizations over the past decade.
                 This trend is led by the great advantages of open source solutions and applications that give the user the flexibility and
                  freedom to customize services and products.
